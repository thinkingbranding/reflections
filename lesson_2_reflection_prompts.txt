What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    A hidden folder, called .git, is added to the directory. This holds the metadata about the history of the repository.
    
    To be able to track changes, without initializing the repository git can't do anything
    
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 

    The staging area holds the files we want to commit to the repository and they maybe fewer than are held in the working directory.

What value do you think it offers?    
    It allows to "bunch" files for a logical commit
    
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    By only staging the files you want to include in the commit
    
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

    when wanting to do something different without losing the original. A new branch will hold those differences and the main branch (master) will remain intact.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    By visually identifying the repo structure.

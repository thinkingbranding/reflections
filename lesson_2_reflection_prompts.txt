What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    A hidden folder, called .git, is added to the directory. This holds the metadata about the history of the repository.
    
    To be able to track changes, without initializing the repository git can't do anything
    
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 

    The staging area holds the files we want to commit to the repository and they maybe fewer than are held in the working directory.

What value do you think it offers?    
    It allows to "bunch" files for a logical commit

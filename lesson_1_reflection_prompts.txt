    Much more easily than when I've done it with the text editor,

    I can more easily assess which solution works better, I can also see how
    I've progressed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a

    Pros: you choose when and what, the message helps to keep track of what has been done
    Cons: you must remember to do it
